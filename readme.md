# Project Pineapple

## View project
You can view the latest state of the project live on Github on the following url: https://rooseal.github.io/pineapple/src/

## Install
The project uses browser-sync for live reloading during development. When you install the npm dependencies, you will get an error if the correct version of Visual Studio is not installed. If you encounter this problem, please update/install the latest version of Visual Studio. This is only necessary if you want to run the project in dev mode. If you only want to view the project you can simply open the index.html file.
